\begin{abstract}
The focus of this paper is implementing a paravirtual graphics card and an X11 device driver for
a virtual machine monitor called Palacios. While Palacios implements a VGA graphics card with
a complex interface to the virtual guest, a paravirtual graphics card provides a simple interface
by writing directly an array of pixels into a chunk of memory, called the framebuffer, which is then
read by an X11 server and rendered onto the screen through an X11 client.
This paper looks at the current implementation of graphics in Palacios and describes the new
implementation with a paravirtual graphics card. It also provides a short description of the X 
client-server model and the X11 driver written for the paravirtual graphics card.

\section{Introduction}
The goal of this paper is to describe an implementation of a paravirtual
graphics card for Palacios, an OS independent open source virtual machine
monitor. \cite{techreport} Palacios is designed to be 
highly configurable and provides a suitable environment
for prototyping new extensions and devices. \cite{techreport} Palacios currently implements
  a virtual VGA card whose interface to the guest VM is very elaborate. The
  purpose of a paravirtual graphics card is to eliminate such complex interface
  by providing a much simpler and more compact one to the guest that can
  consequently make for a substitute for the VGA card altogether. In addition to
  replacing the VGA in Palacios, the paravirtual graphics card's manageable
  interface makes it easy to configure it with an X11 device driver and thus
  enables us to harness the capabilities of the X11 window system and run it with the
  graphics card within a virtual guest. In the following sections we go into
  detail about Palacios' current implementation of graphics, the paravirtual
  graphics card's interface, the X11 window system, and the steps we took in
  building such graphics card and running X on a virtual guest.

\section{Graphics in Palacios}
The way graphics currently work on Palacios comprises of three main components.
The VGA device, the graphics console, and the VNC server/client. In the
following subsection we will give an overview of the VGA device, followed by two
subsections, one describing the graphics console and the other describing the
VNC server/client used in Palacios.

\subsection{VGA}
\subsubsection{What is VGA?}
Palacios currently uses an emulated Video Graphics Array (VGA) device for graphics. VGA is a display standard that was first developed by IBM in 1987 for their PS/2 computers. It was used as an interface between a computer monitor and the hardware. It gave users the ability to operate in one of multiple display modes at a time; two examples of the modes are a 640x480  resolution display with up to 16 colors and a lower resolution display of 320x200 but with up to 256 colors available.\cite{ibmvga} Today, the successors of VGA are still in wide-use by graphic cards, but they are slowly becoming replaced as DVI (Digital Visual Interfaces) and HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) become more popular.
\par
To connect to a monitor, the hardware used a 15-pin connector that allowed communication through signals between the monitor and the VGA device. As seen in Figure 2, each color (red, green, blue) has a dedicated pin for data to flow through as well as specific pins for vertical sync and horizontal sync.\cite{vgahead} Vertical and horizontal sync are digital signals whereas the colors are analog, and used for synchronization of the display. The vertical sync tells a monitor to display a new image and the horizontal sync tells the monitor to refresh a single row of pixels. In the case of VGA 640x480 resolution, each row would be of size 640 pixels and 480 horizontal syncs would be sent before the entire screen is drawn. Once a vertical sync pulse is received, the monitor starts to draw back at its upper-left hand corner. These synchronization pulses sent by the video card are extremely important for creating and maintaining stable images on the screen. Pins 5 through 10, excluding pin 9, are used as grounds for the colors and syncs. The other pins (4, 11, 12, and 15) are called "monitor ID" pins that send information to the video card about what type of monitor it is connected to.\cite{vgahead} Pin 9 is actually plugged and not used for anything, except in helping align the other pins with their respective sockets. 
\par
 In terms of how it works, VGA maintains an internal buffer where it holds the contents of the screen. This internal buffer maintains an array of pixels, representing the screen and this array is written into every time the screen needs to be updated. Thus this buffer always has an updated version of the screen contents.
 \par
 Figure 3 is an interesting analog to Palacios, but is not completely accurate as to what Palacios and the VGA are doing. The guest believes its writing into the frame buffer through the VGA device and thus writing the content onto the screen. In the case of the VGA, each color uses only 1 bits, if it is in 16 color mode, since only 4 bits are needed for 16 different combinations. The last bit is used for intensity, i.e. how dark/light the pixel is.\cite{ibmvga} For 256 color mode, there are 8 bits used. However, instead of each bit corresponding to some color, the bits are an index into a palette of colors  in the VGA BIOS that allowed for use 6 different bits to be used for each color.\cite{ibmvga} While only 256 colors could be shown at any one time, a much larger palette of colors is available to choose the colors from. In actuality, each color could use 8-bits thus effectively having a palette of 2\textsuperscript{24} different colors, but the original VGA only had 6-bits per color in the map. In Palacios, instead of actually having the VGA have a frame buffer to write into, its memory that is written on is then copied into the frame buffer in Palacios graphics console which serves as the interface between the VNC server and Palacios in getting pixels to be written onto the screen. 
 
 \subsubsection{Why try to replace VGA?}
 VGA was very impressive for the time in which it was developed and was the predecessor to want display standards still used today. However, VGA presents a very complex interface due to the fact that it was created in a time when memory was scarce and processing power was much smaller (whole array of pixels did not even fit into processor's address space at once). The intricacy of the device was needed for it run when resources were limited. However, the basic principle of the interface was to have an array of pixels to be written into and then the data about the pixels would be sent to the screen and be displayed. Unfortunately, Palacios has to deal with the convolution that this legacy interface imposes. In addition, trying to use more current interfaces may seem like a way to lower the barrier of complexity since they usually have plenty of resources to be utilized. However, hardware now has advanced such that displays are more complicated due to hardware acceleration features. As such a simple interface such as just an area of memory to write in provides an effective way for graphics in Palacios to work.

\subsection{The Graphics Console} % can add more about its functions
The Graphics Console interface interfaces with a VM's text-mode and graphics
mode display adaptor (e.g. VGA), keyboard, and mouse to allow the host OS to display the VM
console as appropriate. In the Linux module, the graphics console interface implementation provides
for a userspace utility to attach to a frame buffer. The utility then exports this frame buffer, keyboard,
and mouse to remote clients through the VNC protocol. \cite{techreport}
\\
\\
\subsection{VNC}
Palacios uses a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server and a VNC client to
display the guest's screen. 
Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the VNC Protocol to remotely control another computer. 
It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.
The VNC server is the program on the machine that shares its screen and which is controlled by the client.
The VNC client (or viewer) is the program that controls the server and is used to view the screen.
In our implementation,the VNC client makes a request to the VNC server to view the screen. 
The VNC server uses a special system call to request an array of pixels representing the whole screen from Palacios. 
Palacios copies into that array (frame buffer) from an internal array that it
maintains. By connecting to the VNC server, Palacios's graphics console exports
the frame buffer to a VNC client which connects to the VM at a certain port and
displays the screen with the contents of that frame buffer.

\section{Our method}
After describing the interaction between Palacios's VGA virtual device, 
graphics console and the VNC server and client, we now go into detail
about the paravirtual graphics card (Paragraph) that we built to replace the VGA 
device. We also discuss the addition of an X11 server and X11 device driver to
the virtual guest. Figure 2 shows the new addition of Paragraph and X11 to
Palacios and the interaction between these new components on the guest and host
machines. 
\par
When an X11 client is run on the guest (such as xterm for example), it talks to
an X11 server. The X server needs the address of a frame buffer onto which it
draws pixel values. It gets the address of that frame buffer through the device
driver it is configured to use (in our case, the Paragraph device driver). The 
driver searches for the device, and enables it to be written on by the X11
server.  Once Paragraph has data written to it, it renders a
screen display to the graphics console in Palacios, which stores it in memory
and allows host user access to it. The VNC server uses this access to make the 
screen contents available via the VNC protocol. The VNC client connects to the 
VNC server, gets the content and displays on screen.

\caption{The new model of graphics in Palacios}   
\end{figure}                                                   
\subsection{ParaGraph: The Paravirtual Graphics Card}
A paravirtual graphics card is essentially a way of representing a graphics card
interface to a virtual guest that is similar but not identical to its hardware
implementation. In our case, we have Paragraph, a virtual graphics card device
that offers the guest a very straightforward interface which is simply: write
the array of pixels. Paragraph's configuration specifies how to write to the
internal array of pixels that Palacios uses to copy from into the frame buffer
that is maintained by the graphics console. 
The device uses a single Base Address Register (BAR) to project the graphics console to the guest as a PCI device. 
The BAR maps the memory of the frame buffer used by the graphics console. 
\subsubsection{Data Structures}
In order to register Paragraph as a PCI device on the guest, a struct was used
to represent and store Paragraph's state. The struct stores information such as
Paragraph's physical address in the guest, and the size of its mapped region in
pages. It also maintains records regarding the VM, the PCI bus, the VM devices and PCI
devices. If Paragraph is configured to be used as memory, fields for its
physical and virtual addresses are used to store such information. If the
graphics console is used for memory, then the appropriate spec information is
also kept in the paragraph state struct. 
\subsubsection{Configuration}
Paragraph can be set to 1 of 3 modes: \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item MEM: Paragraph is used directly as backing memory on which the pixel values
are stored.
\item GCONS\textunderscore MEM: Paragraph is used as backing memory but its contents are
then rendered to the graphic console's frame buffer.
\item GCONSD\textunderscore DIRECT: The graphics console is used directly as memory.
\end{enumerate}
When Paragraph is configured to MEM mode, it can be mapped into a chunk of
memory (mmap) and then written to directly. Whatever is written to it will be
passed on to the VNC server and displayed on the screen. When Paragraph is set
to GCONS\textunderscore MEM, whatever gets written on Paragraph will then be
copied to the graphic console's frame buffer (memcpy) and the VNC server will
display its contents on Screen. Finally, if Paragraph is set to GCONS
\textunderscore DIRECT, nothing will be written on the device, the graphic
console will be written to directly.

The Paragraph device projects a graphics console to the guest as a PCI device
Paragraph's length was configured to 4MB and it was given the physical address
of 0x80000000. Paragraph's implementation includes the required initialization
such as registering it as a PCI device and initializing the PCI BAR. 
Due to its fairly simple nature, Paragraph's implementation is written with less than 300 lines of code.
Table 1 describes some important Paragraph Device functions.
\begin{table}
 \centering
  \caption{Paragraph Functions}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|p{4cm}|} \hline
  \textbf{Function Name}&\textbf{Description}\\ \hline
 paragraph\textunderscore init & Initializes Paragraph based on the mode and allocates Paragraph memory .\\ \hline
 bar\textunderscore init & Initializes Base Address Register \\ \hline
 bar\textunderscore write & Writes onto the BAR, i.e. the frame buffer of the Graphics Console. \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{X11}
X (called X11 since 1987) originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1984.
X11 provides a basis for GUI and allows input control even over remote machines. A user can control a remote screen using the input devices connected to his machine only.\cite{xguide} Thus X provides windowing on computer displays and is able to manage keyboards, mice and touch-screens.
The server is the computer or X terminal with the screen, keyboard, mouse and server program and the clients are application programs. 
Clients may run on the same computer as the server or on a different computer.\cite{xguide}
XClients and Xservers communicate using the X Protocol which takes on a client-server model. X protocol can run over the UNIX Domain sockets, TCP/IP, or DECnet.\cite{xguide} The client sends requests to the server, such as having to draw something to draw on the screen. The server will then process this request and send a response, so it will write to the screen. This is contrary to most ideas of client-server interaction because the client can only ask for images to be drawn, but does not draw them itself. In addition, the Xserver receives input from input devices like mice and keyboards and send this data to the client. 
One important thing about X11 is the network-transparency, that is a user can access a resource (like something from an Xserver) without needing to know if the resource is on the local machine or a remote one. 

Figure 5 shows an example client-server interaction in X11. 
 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
 \epsfig{file=X11.eps, height=3in, width=2in}
 \caption{X11 Client-Server model}
 \end{figure}

\subsubsection{X11 Configuration File}
Starting up X11 requires configuration either from the command line, environmental variables or from a configuration file. In this case, xorg.conf is the configuration that details how one wants to layout the screen or screens, what graphics device they wish to use, what driver for that device, they are using, as well as many optional fields. Table 1 gives a short description of each of these sections. Most of these sections are actually optional with only a few important ones that require one or devices to be described.\cite{config} 
\par
The \textbf{Inputdevice section} is optional if hotplugging, the ability to connect devices to the computer while it is already running, is enabled.\cite{config}  Otherwise, at least two Inputdevices sections are necessary: one for the primary mouse and one for the primary keyboard. In these sections, an Identifier field that gives the device a custom name is required as well as a Driver field that specifies the name of the input device's driver. No other fields are required, however, one can add multiple options to customize the effects of these devices.
\par
Another required field is the \textbf{Device section} which identifies the video card that X11 will use. There can multiple of these entries, but at least one is mandatory to have for X11 to start properly. Similar to the Inputdevice sections, only the Identifier and Driver fields are necessary for this section while the others are not required to be filled out. Unlike the Inputdevice fields though, the Device optional fields can be mandatory given the type of video card being used and how many. Fore example, if one is using a single monitor but with two graphics cards then both cards BusID must be provided.\cite{config}
\par
The \textbf{Screen section} is also required which again requires the Identifier and Device fields to be filled out. The Device field gives the Identifier to a graphics card described in a Device Section. In addition, there is normally a Monitor field also filled out that has the id of a monitor that was defined in a Monitor section. This section used to bind a screen to a graphics card or more generally, if there is only one screen and one monitor, bind a video card to a monitor.\cite{config}
\par
While the Screen section is used to bind monitors to video cards, the \textbf{Monitor section} is not actually required, but it is recommended to have at least one of them. \cite{config}The only field required is an ID, however, information about the monitor like its Horizontal and Vertical Sync frequencies can be optionally given.
\par
The last required section is the \textbf{Serverlayout}. This binds together screens and input devices.\cite{config} This is the highest layer in the configuration file, binding all the necessary devices together to form a coherent X11 setup. For fields, it only requires an Identifier and one or more Screen ids. The Screen field needs to have the id of the screen being used and also has options for relative and absolute positioning of each screen if there is more than one. While not technically required, when there are input devices, they would be given in the InputDevice field with their respective id. Normally, this would entail providing the id for a mouse and keyboard. 
All other unfilled optional sections will be filled in with defaults, if needed, when X11 begins to run.

  \caption{xorg.conf Sections}
  \begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|} \hline
  \textbf{Section Name}&\textbf{Description}\\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{X11 Control Flow}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Parsing/Probing Phase} \\
The InitOutput function is called in the main() of X11 whenever a server is created and is expected to fill in the global structure, {\tt screenInfo} and a {\tt screenInfo.screen[]} for every screen used.\cite{xorgman} The following steps are done when InitOutput is called:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Parse the xorg.conf file:} \\
The file is read and stored into data structures but not processed at all. \cite{xorgman}
\item \textit{Process Information:} \\
The parsed information and any command line options are now processed to determine which section in the xorg.conf file are active (being used for this server) and what paths it may have to look in for files needed. \cite{xorgman}
This processing as well as the parsing of the config file are only done when the first server is made. 
\item \textit{Port I/O Access Enabled}
\item \textit{General Bus Probe:} \\
Only done when first server created. In case of Palacios, it will be a PCI probe and given the data attained to drivers if they call for it.\cite{xorgman}
\item \textit{Load initial set of modules:} \\
Only done when first server created. Loads any required modules, modules specified in the configuration file, and any modules for drivers that have active devices.\cite{xorgman}
\item \textit{Register Drivers:} \\
Only done when first server created. Registers input and video drivers by adding certain essential info about the drivers to their respective arrays, {\tt xf86DriverList[]} \& \\ {\tt xf86InputDriverList[]}. \cite{xorgman}
\item \textit{Probe Video Drivers} \\
Only done when first server created. To probe the video drivers, a function called {\tt ChipProbe} is called. This is used to find all hardware that the driver supports. An {\tt ScreenInfoRec} is partially initialized and allocated for every piece of active devices that can be supported. \cite{xorgman}
\item \textit{Match Screens} \\
Only done when first server created. This stage checks all the {\tt ScreenInfoRecs} and sees if the xorg.conf file had them active. If not, the {\tt ScreenInfoRecs} is deleted. \cite{xorgman}
\item \textit{Allocate PCI Resources} \\
Only done when first server created.
Resources for PCI devices probed are allocated. Any conflicting resources between devices are resolved. \cite{xorgman}
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Driver Function Phase} \\
While we are still in the InitOutput() function, the majority of driver functions are called. These functions are not all really necessary for our ParaGraph Device to work, but are needed for X11 to work properly. While The Probe function is also a driver function, the next phase focusing almost completely on calling driver functions. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{PreInit Called} \\
Only done when first server created.
A drivers PreInit function is called to get all the data needed to see if the configuration given is stable and able to be used. It also initializes the majority of the fields in the ScrnInfoRec struct If any configuration for a ScrnInfoRec is unusable, it is deleted. \cite{xorgman}
\item \textit{Clean up Unused Drivers} \\
Any drivers whose ScrnInfoRec was deleted can have their modules and themselves unloaded. \cite{xorgman}
\item \textit{ScreenInit Called} \\
The {\tt AddScreen()} function is called and uses the ScreenInit function. This will add a new screen to the {\tt screenInfo.screen[]} array. \\ AddScreen() should then return the index of the screen. The function shouldn't fail due to configuration problems, but only if resources are given or there are bugs in the programs. \cite{xorgman}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Event Handling Phase} \\
InitOutput() should now finish and all screens should be initialized. Now whenever an event occurs an appropriate function in the driver will be called to handle it. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{SwitchMode Event}
\item \textit{Change Viewport Event}
\item \textit{VT (Virtual Terminal) Switch Event}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why use X11?}
In many ways, X11 is very flexible and extensible, making a good candidate to be ported onto a Palacios Guest. Due to how X11 was developed, it is hardware-independent making it possible to use on most hardware configurations. As Palacios has many hardware customizations in terms of what is being used, X11 would be very compatible since it should run on most configurations. Moreover, X11 only provides basic frameworks for a GUI. As such, if it were decided to create software on guests that may require or would be nicer with a GUI, then X11 could be used to create an XClient application for the VM. Finally, Palacios currently is running a emulated shell program and it would be good if it could run a full-fledged shell program. With X11 installed and working, xterm could be used as an alternative to the existing terminal, offering more options and higher functionality. 

\subsubsection{X11 device driver for Paragraph}
The X11 server requires device drivers to identify and communicate with devices.
To identify a driver for a particular device, Xorg uses a configuration file, xorg.conf, for its initial setup as describe in Section 3.2.1. 
In our case, we needed to write a device driver for Paragraph which the X server can
write onto. We used 
X11 drivers come with a set of mandatory functions that they must perform. Table
3 lists these functions.
The dummy\_driver.c found in X11's directory of driver's was used as a template for our driver because it was the most
bare-bones of all the drivers provided by X11. 
Due to Paragraph's straightforward and simple interface, the device driver only
needed slight editing in order for it to communicate with paragraph. A simple
mmap function was used to map paragraph to a chunk of memory and return
paragraph's virtual address, which would consequently be used as the frame
buffer's base address. The X11 server writes to the memory at that address.
All other functions in our device driver remained the same as they were before in the dummy\_driver.c file. 
This is possible because most of the functions called in the drivers are just used to setup the server and are not 
necessary for our paragraph device to work properly. This file contains about 800 lines of code, in which we added only around 10 lines.
A VGA driver, in comparison, has around 1800 lines of code. A thousand more lines than we even need.

\section{Results}
The goal of this project was to write a paravirtual graphics card and run an X11
client on the guest that uses this graphics card. Professor Dinda aided us
greatly by providing us with a Paragraph framework that helped us in the first
part, as for running an X11 client, we ran into many issues due to our lack of
experience with X. We were able to create a paravirtual graphics card device
that can be configured. 
We were also able to configure an X11 device driver that used such a device as a
frame buffer for the X11 server to render to. However, we still have not been able to run
the X server on the guest, mainly due to our use of a fairly limited guest OS
that don't have all the devices or libraries that the X server needs.

We faced many challenges that stopped our progress from proceeding as quickly as thought it might have. The main problems faced with were getting the X11 Server up and running. The right libraries for X11 needed to be linked dynamically, and none of these drivers were on the guests. There were also required programs such as pixman that were not on the VMs. In addition, many guests just did not work with X11 for one reason or another so many of them were tried before X11 was actually able to be run. 
\section{Outstanding Issues}
Running the X server on the virtual guest requires it to be reconfigured. The
use of another guest that has pseudo terminals installed. A
\textit{pseudo\textunderscore terminal} is a special interprocess communication
channel that acts like a terminal. One end of the channel is called the master side or master pseudo-terminal device, 
the other side is called the slave side. 
Data written to the master side is received by the slave side as if it was the result of a user typing at an ordinary terminal, 
and data written to the slave side is sent to the master side as if it was written on an ordinary terminal.
X11 clients such as xterm use pseudo terminals to implement their terminal emulation functionality.
In addition, the Xserver sometimes runs into a Segmentation Fault whose reason for occurring is unknown presently.

\section{Acknowledgments}
We would like to thank Peter Dinda for the many, many hours he spent tirelessly with us as we
tried to get the X server running on the virtual guest, and for all the
resources and frameworks he provided us with. We would also like to thank Kyle
Hale for sending us all the different guest OS's and reconfiguring them for us
whenever we needed them. Thanks to our diligent undergraduate assistants Prem
Seetharaman, Jack Hudson, and Josiah Matlack for putting up with us during and
not during their office hours.
